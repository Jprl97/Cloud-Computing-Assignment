The Ramen Bar Restaurant
•	Background of the enterprise – 1-2 sentences
  The Ramen Bar is the restaurant where I work. The restaurant was creasted around 6 years ago, and they used to have another company vinculated to them, which called Kokoro Sushi Bento.
  
•	Current IT setup
  The current IT setup that they have consiste in the will the orders are put in the system, and what is related with food, goes to kitchen, and those that are related with drinks goes straight to the bar.
   Other point about IT is payment method, that I would say around 90% of the transactions are doing by card, and the other 10% by cash, which we still need to put in the system to check all the money that the restaurant made per day.
    Last thing that I can mentioned is about suppliers. They are a huge restaurant, what means that a variety of deliveries are expected everyweek, as a wines, beers, drinks in general, and mainly, food suppliers, as a Tofu company, fish company, asian stuff in general and so on.

•	Recommendations, including:
   My recomendations, based in what I know about that place, which I am one of in charge there, so I am basically doing amost everything, either counting the money, or ordering deliveries and many other things that is part of my job is:
    Specifically about Cloud computing, I can say about the way that we archive the statement from each day. Of course we have a accountant, whose takes all the document, invoices, everything. however, in the end of each day, after counting the money, we need to send the statement by WhatsApp to the owner. My point is, we could have a cloud computing system that we could just upload all information each day, with not only the money sheet, but also if all the deliveries company invoices that we use.
    To conclude my report, I will say that a cloud system would be a great solution for the restaurant to make easy to gather all information that is useful to check the finances from the shop.
